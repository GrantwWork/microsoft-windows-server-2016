  configuration errors, troubleshoot service disruptions, and analyze compromises
  that have occurred, as well as detect attacks. Audit logs are necessary to
  provide a trail of evidence in case the system or network is compromised.
  Collecting this data is essential for analyzing the security of information
  assets and detecting signs of suspicious and unexpected behavior.

      Plug and Play activity records events related to the successful connection
